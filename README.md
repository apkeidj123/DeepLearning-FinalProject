# DeepLearning-FinalProject
## Image Caption

Abstract â€” Our task is image caption generation of computer vision which means that given an image, we have to generate textual information for the image. We designed the encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder we used the pre-trained InceptionV3 network to get the features, and in the decoder we used the bidirectional LSTM. In addition, the results of adding the attention mechanism and not adding the attention mechanism were also compared. Finally, we used the COCO, Flickr8 dataset for training and testing, and used CIDER and BLEU to rate our results.
